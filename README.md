# Global Unicorn Club Analysis 2025

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the CB Insights Global Unicorn Club 2025 dataset, tracking 1,285 startups valued at $1 billion or more (unicorns). The project cleans, processes, and analyzes data to uncover insights into unicorn valuations, industries, geographic distributions, and temporal trends. Built in Microsoft Excel, it showcases data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization skills, ideal for a data analysis or business intelligence portfolio.

## Project Description
The dataset includes company valuations, countries, industries, and dates of achieving unicorn status. Key tasks include:
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardized formats, handled missing/truncated data, and derived columns (e.g., Year, Month from Date Joined).
- **Analysis**: Aggregated metrics: total valuation ($4,662.93B), top unicorns (e.g., SpaceX at $350B), industry breakdowns (Enterprise Tech: 429 unicorns), and geographic trends (55 countries, US/China dominate).
- **Visualizations**: Bar charts (top unicorns), pie charts (industry distribution), and time-series plots using Excelâ€™s charting tools.
- **Insights**: Identified 2021 valuation surge ($1,133.35B), AI-driven unicorns in 2024-2025 (e.g., xAI), and ~29% value concentration in top 10 firms.
